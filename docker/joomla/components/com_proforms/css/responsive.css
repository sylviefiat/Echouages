/*
*	This is the CSS file for customizing the RESPONSIVE! view of Proforms.
*	There is another system-responsive CSS file which is loaded before this one.
* 	The system CSS does contain all necessary and required rules so that the form is responsive.
*   If you are not a CSS expert don't change the CSS here.
*   If you are intermediate we strongly suggest not applying following rules to the CSS:
*
*   - Don't set any `width`, `min-width` or `max-width`. 
*     Width adjustment goes by form element adjustment in Proforms' backend.
*   - Don't set any `display` rules just as display:inline , display: block etc. 
*     If you set the wrong values Proforms' responsive functionallity can be broken.
*   - Don't set any `box-sizing`, `-webkit-box-sizing` or `-moz-box-sizing rules`.
*   - Never set any `float` or `clear` rules!
*   - Never set any `position` rules!
